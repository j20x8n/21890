The capstone enables students to demonstrate mastery of disciplinary knowledge in their field in the context of resolving a substantial industry or workplace issue. Students reflect critically on theory and professional practice to identify an issue, develop a research question, source and critically analyse literature and data, formulate findings, and produce a series of meaningful recommendations. The completed project demonstrates students’ ability to apply knowledge and skills with a high level of personal autonomy and accountability, and articulate original ideas and thought processes to make a practical contribution to the existing body of knowledge relevant to their profession. In preparing a written report, and making a presentation of their process and outcomes, students demonstrate professional-level competence.
